## Development Environment Configuration

### This document will serve as a light walkthrough of setting up my personal development environment.

## Prerequisites

- WSL2
- Windows Terminal
- Debian
- ZSH (as the interactive shell)
- oh-my-zsh
- tmux
- NeoVim
- NvChad

## Migration Instructions
1. Start with cloning the files down into a directory under `~/dotfiles`.
2. Then cp the files into their respective locations:
   - `~/.bashrc`
   - `~/.zshrc`
   - `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
   - `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/`
   - `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/custom.zsh-theme`

  The remaining files are for the Windows Terminal. You can copy sections of the settings.json into it's respective location.
  (Would not advise copying the entireity just sections around the default profile.)
  Store the images wherever you'd like, just link to them within the settings.json

There are certainly better ways to acheive this, but this more explicit method will work for now.

The document will not contain all steps to reproduce the environment.
